                Hello! My name is Kate Dillon and I am currently a second year student at the University of San Francisco, where I am majoring in Design and minoring in Film Studies. I am currently working as a Lab Assistant in the USF Design labs and as a Design forward Promotions Director at KUSF, USF’s college radio station.

                I found a love for art and all things creative at a young age, and always felt like this was the path I was going to take. Going into sophomore year of high school I was presented with an opportunity extending from my professional skateboarding career, where my manager at the time gave me the step in the door at starting my own art collective and clothing brand. That brand “The Comradery Collective” took off and is one of my proudest accomplishments as we sold out collections, were featured in magazines, and reached 7 different countries. After that experience and seeing the difference I could make, I knew this is the path I wanted to take and began my time at USF! Right now I am focusing on mastering my skills in programs such as the Adobe Suite, HTML/CSS code and many others. I hope to use my design knowledge to one day design titles and posters for the film industry.
